## Video editing

When editing, first define the source video as the **sole editing master**, then
specify edit target, scope, target material, and content to preserve. The output
preserves the input's aspect ratio and approximately preserves duration (±0.3s
from transition-frame handling).

### General editing pattern

```
[Edit Goal]
Edit @Video 1. Within <the entire video or a specific time range>,
<add, remove, replace, or adjust> <visual object, region, or audio category>.

[Source Video Role]
@Video 1 is the sole editing master. It defines <characters, scene, actions, composition,
camera movement, occlusion relationships, audio, and event order>.

[Target Material Role]
@Image 1 or @Audio 1 defines <specified attributes of the target object or sound>.

[Edit Scope]
Modify only <object, region, time range, or audio category>.

[Content to Preserve]
Keep <visual content, motion, audio, and timing relationships that must not change> from @Video 1.
```

### Subject replacement with Timeline Inheritance

The target object **inherits every appearance, motion, occlusion, and exit** of
the original object, including timing, duration, path, and speed changes.

```
[Edit Goal]
Edit @Video 1. Change only <original object> to <target object>.

[Source Video Role]
@Video 1 is the sole editing master. It defines the original scene, camera position, camera
movement, motion path, occlusion relationships, and event order.

[Target Reference Role]
@Image 1 defines <target object>'s <appearance, structure, or material>. Do not use <irrelevant
background, people, or composition>.

[Edit Scope]
Modify only <specific object and area>. The entire video contains <number> target object(s).
Do not modify <content to preserve>.

[Timeline Inheritance]
<Target object> inherits every appearance, motion, occlusion, and exit of <original object>,
including timing, duration, path, and speed changes.
Except for the object or area explicitly modified above, keep all other people, props, scene
content, camera movements, cuts, and event order from @Video 1 unchanged.
```

### Background replacement

Swap the background while preserving the subject's silhouette, identity, motion,
and occlusion relationships.

```
[Edit Goal]
Edit @Video 1. Replace only <original background area> with <target environment> from @Image 1.

[Source Video Role]
@Video 1 is the sole editing master. It defines the people, foreground objects, actions,
composition, camera movement, and event order.

[Target Reference Role]
@Image 1 defines only <target environment>'s spatial layout, materials, depth of field, ambient
color, and lighting direction. Do not use the people or foreground objects in the image.

[Edit Scope]
Modify only <background outside the subject's silhouette>. Do not modify <subject identity, facial
features, hairstyle, clothing, expression, position, size, or motion>.

[Timeline Inheritance]
Keep the character actions and occlusion relationships from @Video 1. Except for the modified
area, keep all other content from @Video 1 unchanged.
```

### Audio editing

Dialogue, language, voice, background music, and sound effects can be edited
**separately** from visuals.

```
Edit @Video 1. Remove only the original background music. Keep the character dialogue, lip sync,
ambience, and action sound effects; preserve the visuals, camera treatment, and editing rhythm
from @Video 1.

Edit @Video 1. Change <Presenter>'s spoken language to natural American English while preserving
the dialogue content and speaking times. Keep all other character voices, background music,
ambience, and visuals from @Video 1.
```

For the full language-swap pattern (English ⇄ Chinese/Japanese, re-lip-sync with
visuals locked), see the "Language swap / audio edit (re-lip-sync)" subsection
of `seedance-vfx-prompt`.
