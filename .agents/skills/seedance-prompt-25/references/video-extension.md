## Video extension

Video extension creates content beyond the boundary of a source video.
- **Forward extension**: extension's first frame continues from the source's last frame.
- **Backward extension**: extension's last frame connects to the source's first frame.

### Forward extension

```
@Video 1 is the source video to extend forward.

Extend @Video 1 forward. The first frame of the extended segment directly continues from the last
frame of @Video 1. Maintain continuity in <subject pose and orientation>, <prop position>,
<background and spatial relationships>, <camera position and composition>, <lighting>, and
<motion direction>.

Then, <describe the new action, event, camera treatment, or audio to add>.

Throughout the extension, maintain continuity in <character identity and clothing>, <key props>,
<background layout>, and <axis of action>.
Keep each subject as the same continuous instance throughout: do not duplicate or split it, and
keep the person's appearance or the object's number of parts stable.
```

With additional references — define every material's role first, then state the
source video controls the boundary. New materials may supplement but **must not
override** the source video's last-frame control.

```
@Image 1 defines <Character A>'s facial features.
@Image 2 defines <Character A>'s clothing.
@Image 3 defines <key prop>'s structure and material.
@Video 1 is the source video to extend forward.

Extend @Video 1 forward. The first frame of the extended segment directly continues from the last
frame of @Video 1. Maintain continuity in <boundary-frame state>.

Then, <Character A uses the key prop to complete a new action or event>.

Throughout the extension, maintain continuity in <character identity and clothing>, <key prop>,
<background layout>, and <axis of action>.
Keep each subject as the same continuous instance throughout.
```

### Backward extension

Describe what happens **before** the source video, then define the source's first
frame as the **explicit end state**. Writing only "connect to the source video"
is not enough — it can let characters or effects enter too early.

```
@Video 1 is the source video to extend backward.

Extend @Video 1 backward. Before the source video begins, <describe the preceding action, event,
camera treatment, or audio>.

The last frame of the extended segment naturally connects to the first frame of @Video 1:
<subject pose and orientation>, <prop position>, and <background and spatial relationships>.
Match the <camera position and composition>, <lighting>, and <motion direction> of @Video 1's
first frame.

Throughout the extension, maintain continuity in <character identity and clothing>, <key props>,
<background layout>, and <axis of action>.
Keep each subject as the same continuous instance throughout.
<Materials that should appear only after the source video begins> must not appear early.
```

> Boundary frames connect naturally at a visual level; they will **not** be
> pixel-identical. Inspect both sides of the boundary during review.

### Backward extension with additional references

Define each material's role, and state which materials are used in the backward
extension and which should appear **only after** the source video begins. This
reduces the chance that later characters, props, or effects enter the preceding
segment too early.

```
@Image 1 defines <Character A>'s facial features.
@Image 2 defines <Character A>'s clothing.
@Image 3 defines <key prop>'s structure and material.
@Video 1 is the source video to extend backward.

Extend @Video 1 backward. Before the source video begins, <Character A completes a preceding
action or event>.

The last frame of the extended segment naturally connects to the first frame of @Video 1:
<Character A's pose and orientation>, <key prop's position and state>, and <other characters'
positions>. Match the <background and spatial relationships>, <camera position and composition>,
<lighting>, and <motion direction> of @Video 1's first frame.

Keep each subject as the same continuous instance throughout: do not duplicate or split it.
<Materials that should appear only after the source video begins> must not appear early in the
backward extension.
```
